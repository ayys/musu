* Intro
The Guile  API for  Musu describes  two layers  of the  API I  need to
implement to get musu running from Guile.

The first is the top level  interface which can be customized by users
to change  the behaviour of Musu.  This includes being able  to change
the animation  flow, art,  and the movement  mechanics of  Musu. Using
this, users can in theory, create a more interactive musu that perhaps
sleeps when it's late, or is more playful in the afternoon.

* FFI transition plans
This section  outlines the  FFI design  for **musu**.  The goal  is to
allow users to  write custom logic that gets incorportated  into the C
core  by separating  the stable  C  core from  the customizable  Guile
environment using **Hooks** and **Advice** for logic injection.
